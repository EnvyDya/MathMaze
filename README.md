Project made in 2019 by Clément BONDUELLE, Thibault BOURGEAIS and Thomas DEHEE for the final exam of "Informatique et Sciences du Numérique" course.

In this game, you have to beat the game and answer math questions to access other areas. The map is proceduraly generated and everything is coded in pure HTML/CSS/JS. Unfortunately, as of today (16/07/2024), the project doesn't work anymore because of safety evolution from our browsers.
